**Quiz Master:** A React-Based Trivia Application

**Overview**
Quiz Master is an interactive web-based trivia application designed to challenge users with a variety of questions across different categories. Leveraging the power of React and CSS, this application offers a seamless and dynamic user experience, enriching the process of learning through quizzes. The core functionality includes fetching trivia questions from an API, presenting them in a randomized order, and scoring user responses in real-time.

**Features**
**Dynamic Question Fetching:** Utilizes the Open Trivia Database API to fetch a set of 5 trivia questions in the "Animals" category at an "easy" difficulty level. This ensures a fresh experience with every quiz attempt.
**Interactive Quiz Flow:** Users can select answers for each question, with the application tracking selections and providing immediate visual feedback on correctness upon submission.
**Real-Time Scoring and Feedback:** At the end of the quiz, users are presented with their scores and correct answers. High scores trigger a vibrant confetti animation, celebrating the user's success.
**Answer Randomization:** To keep the quiz challenging, answers are shuffled for every question, preventing pattern recognition and encouraging true knowledge testing.
**State Management with React Hooks:** Utilizes React's useState and useEffect hooks for managing quiz data, user selections, and the quiz's state (e.g., question fetching, answer checking).

**Technologies Used**
**React:** Empowers the application with a component-based architecture, facilitating efficient state management and dynamic content rendering.
**CSS:** Custom stylesheets enhance the UI, providing a visually appealing and intuitive user interface that adapts responsively to different devices.
**react-confetti:** Adds an engaging visual reward for high-scoring users, leveraging third-party library integration within React apps.
